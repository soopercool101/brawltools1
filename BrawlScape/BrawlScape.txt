|************ How to Use ************|
 ====================================

1. Get a hold of the game data files. There are a few ways to do this, but the best way IMHO is to use WiiScrubber.
	I won't show you how to do this. Use google and download the program.
	
2. Once you have extracted the disc files into a folder on your hard drive, create a second (empty) folder.
	Either on your computer or an SD card.

3. Open BrawlScape and enter in those two folders on the first (Project) tab.
	The Data folder is where you extracted the game files to.
	The project folder is where your empty folder is.

4. Once you have set your data locations, continue on to the next tabs.

5. Use the right mouse button to open sub-menus. These will allow you to edit resources and textures.

6. When you are finished editing, go back to the Project tab and click save.
	The program will now save any changes you've made to the project location.
	If this is on an SD card, it may take a little longer.

7. Use the new data to create an ISO or do some SD loading.
