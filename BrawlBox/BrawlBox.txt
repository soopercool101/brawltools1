- v0.58 - (09/29/2009)
	. Name has changed to BrawlBox (previously SmashBox)
	. Program has been separated, allowing for the creation of BrawlLib.
	. Now has minor Linux support.
	. Audio nodes/controls have been temporarily disabled until BrawlLib can be updated.
	. You can now use SaveAs on the current working file, so long as changes have been made.

- v.057 - (08/23/2009)
	. Added support for brstm files.
	. Increased support for brsar audio packages.
	. Added audio playback control for use with brsar and brstm files.
	. Added the ability to export audio to .wav format.

- v0.56 - (08/09/2009)
	. Added support for TGA images.
	. Re-wrote the LZ77 algorithm for increased speed.
	. Due to compatibility problems with paletted images and transparent colors. All images are now exported in 32-bit format.

- v0.55b - (08/04/2009)
	. Fixed a bug that was causing unknown files to disappear entirely. (Thanks lavamage)
	. Fixed a bug with pre-paletted textures that was causing them to recreate the palette improperly. (Thanks kid craft 24/sonic master)
	. Added a progress bar for those long compression jobs.
	. Discovered another portion of model files that needs an entry in the BRES string table.

	. Fixed various issues with Common pac files.
	. Fixed an issue with certain compressed files. Character selection portraits are now supported.
	. Added support for more image formats (bmp, gif, jpg, still waiting on TGA)
	. Started incorporating change tracking which offers improvements such as:
		a. Active discovery; Nodes will only be interpreted as they are browsed. Helps with large/embedded files.
		b. Only portions of the tree that have changed will be re-built. 
		c. Unchanged nodes will be copied back as-is. This helps with speed and compatibility.
	. Removed Managed DirectX 9 dependency. Was causing assembly problems.
	. Added child-only properties

- v0.54 - (08/01/2009)
	. Fixed a bug during texture replacing that was causing problems in some files (common pacs).
	. Added various improvements to MDL0 file browsing.
	. Confirmed successful rebuilding of 'common' files.

- v0.53b - (07/29/2009)
	. Fixed a bug dealing with vertex/color data types by removing vertex parsing.
