- v0.58b- (10/24/2009)
	. Re-integration with BrawlLib is nearly complete. Audio support still isn't finished.
	. Added support for the following new controls from BrawlLib:

- v0.55b - (08/04/2009)
	. Fixed a bug that was causing unknown files to disappear entirely. (Thanks lavamage)
	. Fixed a bug with pre-paletted textures that was causing them to recreate the palette improperly. (Thanks kid craft 24/sonic master)

	. Fixed various issues with Common pac files.
	. Fixed an issue with certain compressed files. Character selection portraits are now supported.
	. Added support for more image formats (bmp, gif, jpg, still waiting on TGA)

		a. Active discovery; Nodes will only be interpreted as they are browsed. Helps with large/embedded files.
		b. Only portions of the tree that have changed will be re-built. 
		c. Unchanged nodes will be copied back as-is. This helps with speed and compatibility.
	. Removed Managed DirectX 9 dependency. Was causing assembly problems.
